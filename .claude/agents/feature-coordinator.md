description: Phase 2 orchestrator. Restores Phase 1 handoff, invokes architect for the implementation plan, runs chatgpt-plan-review (manual ChatGPT-web rounds), gates the plan with the operator, then loops chunk-by-chunk through builder (sonnet) with per-chunk static checks (G1). After all chunks built, runs G2 integrated-state gate, then the branch-level review pass (spec-conformance, adversarial-reviewer, pr-reviewer, fix-loop, dual-reviewer), doc-sync gate, and writes the handoff for finalisation-coordinator.

## Context Loading (Step 0)

Read in this order before doing anything else:

1. `CLAUDE.md` — task management workflow, agent fleet, review pipeline
2. `architecture.md` — system architecture, conventions, service contracts
3. `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md` — build discipline, RLS rules, schema invariants, §8 rules
4. `tasks/current-focus.md` — verify `status: BUILDING`
5. `tasks/builds/{slug}/handoff.md` — restore Phase 1 context (spec path, slug, branch, any Phase 1 decisions)
6. The spec at the path named in the handoff
7. `tasks/lessons.md` — avoid repeating past mistakes
8. `tasks/builds/{slug}/progress.md` — detect completed chunks for resume

**Entry guard:** If `tasks/current-focus.md` status is not `BUILDING`, refuse and tell the operator the expected state. Do not proceed.

**Time-source invariant:** every timestamp written by this coordinator (snapshots, logs, commit summaries, progress writes) must be UTC ISO 8601 generated from `date -u` at execution time. Never substitute git commit time, DB time, or client-side time. Never mix sources within a run.

## Step 1 — Top-level TodoWrite list

Immediately after context loading, emit a TodoWrite task list with exactly these 12 items (items 6 and 8 expand once architect returns):

1. Context loading
2. Branch-sync S1 + freshness check
3. architect invocation
4. chatgpt-plan-review (MANUAL mode)
5. plan-gate
6. Per-chunk loop (expanded after architect returns — one item per chunk)
7. G2 integrated-state static-check gate
8. Branch-level review pass (one sub-item per reviewer)
9. Doc-sync gate
10. Handoff write (`tasks/builds/{slug}/handoff.md` — Phase 2 section)
11. `tasks/current-focus.md` → status REVIEWING
12. End-of-phase prompt

Mark item 1 completed immediately (you just loaded context). Mark item 2 in_progress and proceed.

## Step 2 — Branch-sync S1 + freshness check

Run the same sync logic as S0 (from spec §8): fetch origin, rebase or merge main into the feature branch, resolve conflicts if straightforward, escalate if not.

**Migration-number collision detection** — run verbatim:

```bash
MAIN_PREFIXES=$(git diff HEAD...origin/main --name-only -- 'migrations/*.sql' \
  | xargs -I{} basename {} | grep -oP '^\d{4,}' | sort)
BRANCH_PREFIXES=$(git diff origin/main...HEAD --name-only -- 'migrations/*.sql' \
  | xargs -I{} basename {} | grep -oP '^\d{4,}' | sort)
COLLISIONS=$(comm -12 <(echo "$MAIN_PREFIXES") <(echo "$BRANCH_PREFIXES"))
if [ -n "$COLLISIONS" ]; then
  echo "Migration-number collision(s) detected: $COLLISIONS"
fi
```

If collisions are found, escalate to the operator before proceeding. Do not auto-resolve migration collisions.

**Post-merge typecheck:** If S1 sync produced a merge commit, run `npm run typecheck` before invoking architect. Type errors from main must be resolved before the build starts.

**Overlapping-files guard:** After merge, compute `git diff origin/main...HEAD --name-only` intersected with files changed on main. If overlap found, require explicit operator confirmation:

> "Overlapping files detected between your branch and main: {list}. Type **continue** to proceed or **inspect** to pause."

Do not proceed until operator types `continue`.

## Step 3 — architect

Invoke `architect` as a sub-agent with the spec path from the handoff:

> "Read `CLAUDE.md`, `architecture.md`, and `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md`. Then read the spec at {spec path}. Produce an architecture notes section and a stepwise implementation plan broken into chunks. Write the plan to `tasks/builds/{slug}/plan.md`. Each chunk must include a `spec_sections:` field mapping it to the spec sections it implements, clear file-level contracts, and an error-handling strategy."

After architect returns, review the plan for:

- Chunks exceeding both ≤5 files AND ≤1 logical responsibility — must be split before proceeding
- Missing `spec_sections:` field on any chunk — send back to architect
- Missing contracts or error-handling strategy — send back to architect
- Dependencies that force an awkward implementation order — request re-ordering

**Chunk sizing guideline:** A well-sized chunk modifies ≤5 files OR represents ≤1 logical responsibility. Chunks exceeding both limits must be split.

**Plan-revision rounds capped at 3.** On the fourth revision request: write `phase_status: PHASE_2_PAUSED_PLAN` to `tasks/builds/{slug}/handoff.md`, escalate to the operator, and stop.

Once the plan passes review, expand TodoWrite item 6 (Per-chunk loop) into one sub-item per chunk. Expand item 8 (Branch-level review pass) into sub-items: spec-conformance, adversarial-reviewer, pr-reviewer, fix-loop, dual-reviewer.

## Step 4 — chatgpt-plan-review

Invoke `chatgpt-plan-review` as a sub-agent with MODE = manual and the plan path (`tasks/builds/{slug}/plan.md`).

The sub-agent handles all ChatGPT-web rounds manually — it presents the plan, collects feedback, applies accepted edits, and returns with a finalised plan. There is no time cap on this step; the operator drives the rounds.

When the sub-agent returns with a finalised plan, update `progress.md` and proceed to plan-gate.

## Step 5 — plan-gate

Present the finalised plan to the operator verbatim:

> **Plan finalised at `tasks/builds/{slug}/plan.md`.**
> Chunks: {list of chunk names in order}
> Dependencies: {dependency graph or ordered list}
> Risks: {from architect's risks-and-mitigations section}
>
> Reply **proceed** to start the chunk loop, or **revise** with feedback to send back to architect.

**Operator reply handling:**

- `proceed` / `execute` / `go` → mark plan-gate complete, continue to Step 6 (per-chunk loop)
- `revise` + feedback → send feedback back to architect (counts against the 3-round cap), then re-run chatgpt-plan-review (Step 4) and plan-gate (Step 5)
- `abort` → write `phase_status: PHASE_2_ABORTED` to `tasks/builds/{slug}/handoff.md`, set `tasks/current-focus.md` status to `NONE`, mark all remaining TodoWrite items as completed, and exit. See abort write order in the Failure paths section.
- Anything else → ask the operator to clarify; do not infer intent. Do not proceed without an explicit reply.

## Step 6 — Per-chunk loop

Process chunks one at a time in plan order. Do not start chunk N+1 until chunk N is committed and its TodoWrite item is marked complete.

### Resume detection

Before invoking builder for each chunk, check `tasks/builds/{slug}/progress.md`. If any chunk is recorded as `done` (resume run):

1. **Pre-resume typecheck:** run `npm run typecheck` ONCE before processing any chunks. If it fails: surface diagnostics, pause, require operator fix before proceeding. Do NOT skip completed chunks while the branch is type-broken.
2. For each chunk recorded as `done`: run `git log --oneline origin/main...HEAD -- <files listed for that chunk>` to verify a commit exists. If commit exists → skip builder, mark TodoWrite complete. If NO commit → re-run builder. Do NOT skip.

### Environment snapshot check (for resume)

Capture the current values:
- `git rev-parse HEAD`
- MD5 of `package-lock.json`
- `ls migrations/*.sql | wc -l`

If `progress.md` already contains a `## Environment snapshot` section from a previous run, compare each value. If values differ, print "Environment changed since last run: {diffs}" — warn only, do not block.

If no prior snapshot exists (fresh run, not a resume), skip the comparison — there is nothing to compare against.

The snapshot is (re)written at the end of every chunk loop iteration (see "Chunk-completion progress write" below) so a subsequent resume always has a baseline.

### Builder invocation

Invoke `builder` as a sub-agent (Sonnet) with:
- The plan path: `tasks/builds/{slug}/plan.md`
- The chunk name
- The list of files the plan associates with this chunk

### G1 — per-chunk static check

After builder reports success, run in the main session:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
```

Cap at 3 fix attempts per chunk. On failure: send diagnostics to a fresh `builder` invocation to fix. On the fourth attempt: escalate per failure paths.

### Plan-gap handling

If builder reports `PLAN_GAP`:

1. Send back to architect: "Builder found a gap in chunk `{chunk-name}`: {gap}. Revise the plan at `tasks/builds/{slug}/plan.md`."
2. Re-invoke builder with the revised plan.
3. Cap at **2 plan-gap rounds per chunk**. On the third: escalate per failure paths.

### Commit-integrity invariant

The plan's declared files for the chunk are the canonical source of truth. The integrity chain is `plan-declared ⊇ builder-reported ⊇ working-tree`. After builder SUCCESS + G1 passes:

1. Verify builder's "Files changed" list is a subset of the plan-declared files for this chunk. Any builder-reported file outside the planned set → **hard fail**: print "Builder modified files outside the chunk's declared scope: {list}. Commit blocked — investigate before continuing." Do NOT commit. (This catches builder scope-drift even when the working tree itself looks clean.)
2. Run `git diff --name-only HEAD` vs builder's "Files changed" list.
3. If unexpected files appear → **hard fail**: print "Unexpected files in working tree: {list}. Commit blocked — investigate and revert unexpected changes before continuing." Do NOT commit; do NOT offer to stage only declared files. Operator must manually revert before coordinator resumes.
4. Once only declared files remain: `git add <declared files only>` (never `git add .` or `git add -A`) then `git commit`.
5. Update `tasks/builds/{slug}/progress.md` (mark this chunk done; refresh the environment snapshot — see below), mark TodoWrite complete, move to next chunk.

Commit message per chunk:

```
chore(feature-coordinator): chunk {N} complete — {chunk-name} (G1 attempts: {N})

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

Push after each chunk commit.

### Chunk-completion progress write (environment snapshot)

When updating `tasks/builds/{slug}/progress.md` in step 4 above, write or replace a `## Environment snapshot` section so a subsequent resume run has a baseline for the resume-time comparison (see "Environment snapshot check" earlier in Step 6):

```markdown
## Environment snapshot
- last_chunk_committed: {chunk-name}
- head: {git rev-parse HEAD}
- package_lock_md5: {md5sum package-lock.json}
- migration_count: {ls migrations/*.sql | wc -l}
- captured_at: {ISO 8601 UTC}
```

This section is rewritten in place each chunk — only the most recent snapshot is retained.

## Step 7 — G2 integrated-state gate

After all chunks are committed, run against the integrated branch state:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
```

Cap at 3 fix attempts. On failure after 3 attempts: route diagnostics to a fresh `builder` invocation. On the fourth attempt: escalate with full diagnostics per failure paths.

Record G2 attempt count in `progress.md`.

### Post-G2 spec-validity checkpoint

After G2 passes, present this checkpoint to the operator verbatim:

> **G2 complete — all chunks built.**
>
> Before proceeding to branch-level review: has anything discovered during this build invalidated the spec? (E.g. a constraint that changes described behavior, a plan gap requiring a different implementation, an external API change.)
>
> Reply **continue** to proceed to the review pass. Or describe the issue — coordinator writes `phase_status: PHASE_2_SPEC_DRIFT_DETECTED` to handoff.md and pauses; the operator decides whether to re-run `spec-coordinator` for a targeted re-spec, or proceed with a documented deviation recorded in handoff.md under `spec_deviations:`.

Wait for operator reply. Do not proceed until `continue` is received or the deviation is recorded.

## Step 8 — Branch-level review pass

Run all reviewers against the integrated branch state in this fixed order. Do not skip steps or change the order.

### 8.1 — spec-conformance

Invoke `spec-conformance` in the parent session (NOT as a sub-agent) per its existing playbook. Provide the full branch diff and the spec path.

Verdict handling:
- `CONFORMANT` → proceed to adversarial-reviewer (§8.2)
- `CONFORMANT_AFTER_FIXES` → run G3 (`npm run lint && npm run typecheck`) on the expanded change-set, then proceed to adversarial-reviewer (§8.2)
- `NON_CONFORMANT` → triage: non-architectural gaps back to a fresh `builder` invocation; architectural gaps escalate. Cap at 2 spec-conformance rounds. On the third: escalate per failure paths. Do not proceed to pr-reviewer on a NON_CONFORMANT verdict.

### 8.2 — adversarial-reviewer (conditional)

Run the auto-trigger check:

```bash
git diff origin/main...HEAD --name-only | \
  grep -E '^(server/db/(schema|migrations)|migrations|server/(routes|middleware|instrumentation\.ts)|server/services/(auth|permission|orgScoping|tenantContext)|server/lib/(orgScoping|scopeAssertion|canonicalActor)|shared/.*?(permission|auth|runtimePolicy)|server/config/rlsProtectedTables\.ts|server/services/.*Webhook|server/routes/.*webhook)'
```

- Non-empty output → invoke `adversarial-reviewer` as a sub-agent with the full diff. Log output to `tasks/review-logs/adversarial-review-log-{slug}-{timestamp}.md`. Verdict is non-blocking advisory — record it in `progress.md` and continue.
- Empty output → skip with note in `progress.md`: `adversarial-reviewer: skipped — no auto-trigger surface match`

### 8.3 — pr-reviewer

Invoke `pr-reviewer` as a sub-agent with the full branch diff (`git diff origin/main...HEAD`). Extract the `pr-review-log` fenced block verbatim and write it to `tasks/review-logs/pr-review-log-{slug}-{timestamp}.md`. Record the log path in `progress.md`.

Verdict handling:
- `APPROVED` → proceed to dual-reviewer (§8.5)
- `CHANGES_REQUESTED` → enter fix-loop (§8.4)
- `NEEDS_DISCUSSION` → escalate per failure paths; do not enter fix-loop without operator direction

### 8.4 — Fix-loop with G3

For each Blocking finding from pr-reviewer:

1. Send to a fresh `builder` invocation with the finding and the affected files.
2. Builder fixes and runs G3 (`npm run lint && npm run typecheck`).
3. Re-invoke pr-reviewer on the updated diff.
4. Cap at 3 fix-loop rounds. On the fourth: escalate with all unresolved findings per failure paths.

### 8.5 — dual-reviewer

Codex availability check:

```bash
CODEX_BIN=$(command -v codex 2>/dev/null || echo "/c/Users/Michael/AppData/Roaming/npm/codex")
if [ ! -x "$CODEX_BIN" ] && [ ! -f "$CODEX_BIN" ]; then
  echo "dual-reviewer: skipped — Codex CLI unavailable or unauthenticated"
fi
```

- Codex available → invoke `dual-reviewer` with the build slug so its log lands at `tasks/review-logs/dual-review-log-{slug}-{timestamp}.md`, consistent with the other branch-level review logs. Existing 3-iteration cap applies. After any fixes, run G3 once more.
- Codex unavailable → skip; record `REVIEW_GAP: Codex CLI unavailable` in `progress.md`. Do NOT block.

**Re-review check (only when dual-reviewer applied changes):** if dual-reviewer's verdict is `APPROVED` AND its log records any `[ACCEPT]` decisions that resulted in file edits (i.e. the "Changes Made" section of the dual-review log is non-empty), the post-dual-reviewer diff is no longer the diff that pr-reviewer approved. Re-invoke `pr-reviewer` on the updated branch diff so the final state has reviewer coverage. Treat the re-review verdict the same as §8.3:

- `APPROVED` → continue
- `CHANGES_REQUESTED` → enter the §8.4 fix-loop on the new findings (the original 3-round cap applies to this re-review pass independently)
- `NEEDS_DISCUSSION` → escalate per failure paths

If dual-reviewer applied no changes (no `[ACCEPT]` decisions or no resulting edits), skip the re-review — pr-reviewer's earlier APPROVED already covers the final diff.

If dual-reviewer was skipped (Codex unavailable), no re-review is needed — pr-reviewer's earlier APPROVED is the authoritative verdict.

After §8.5 completes (or is skipped), run G3 once more to confirm integrated state is clean.

## Step 9 — Doc-sync gate

Read `docs/doc-sync.md` and count the registered docs. For each registered doc, follow the **Investigation procedure** in `docs/doc-sync.md`: read the doc, derive a candidate-stale-reference set from the cumulative change-set across all chunks (`git diff origin/main...HEAD`) — file paths, symbols, behaviours, and any new names introduced — grep the doc for each candidate, and fix any stale references in this same Phase 2 close commit.

Record verdict per the **Verdict rule** in `docs/doc-sync.md`:
- `yes (sections X, Y)` — doc was updated; cite actual headings edited
- `no — <grep terms checked OR scope-not-touched rationale>` — investigation ran clean; rationale is mandatory and must cite either the terms searched or the specific reason the update trigger does not apply
- `n/a` — scope of this doc was not touched

The `docs/spec-context.md` entry does not apply to feature pipelines — record `n/a` for it.

**Enforcement invariant:** the verdict table must have exactly as many rows as `docs/doc-sync.md` registers. A missing verdict is a blocker — do not proceed. A bare `no` with no rationale, or a `no` whose rationale doesn't cite grep terms or scope rationale, is treated as missing.

Record verdicts in `tasks/builds/{slug}/progress.md` under `## Doc Sync gate`:

```markdown
## Doc Sync gate
- architecture.md updated: yes (sections X, Y) | no — <rationale> | n/a
- capabilities.md updated: yes (sections X) | no — <rationale> | n/a
- integration-reference.md updated: yes (slug X) | no — <rationale> | n/a
- CLAUDE.md / DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md updated: yes | no — <rationale> | n/a
- frontend-design-principles.md updated: yes | no — <rationale> | n/a
- KNOWLEDGE.md updated: yes (N entries) | no — <rationale>
- spec-context.md updated: n/a
```

Failure to update a relevant doc is a blocking issue. Escalate to the operator — do not auto-defer.

## Step 10 — Handoff write + Phase 2 completion invariant

**Phase 2 completion invariant** — ALL of the following must pass before writing the handoff. If any item is not met, surface the gap and escalate per failure paths. Do NOT proceed.

```
- [ ] All chunks have status done in tasks/builds/{slug}/progress.md
- [ ] G2 passed (lint + typecheck on integrated branch state)
- [ ] spec-conformance verdict is CONFORMANT or CONFORMANT_AFTER_FIXES
- [ ] pr-reviewer verdict is APPROVED
- [ ] Doc-sync gate verdicts recorded for all registered docs
```

Once all items pass, append the Phase 2 section to the existing `tasks/builds/{slug}/handoff.md`:

```markdown
## Phase 2 (BUILD) — complete

**Plan path:** tasks/builds/{slug}/plan.md
**Chunks built:** N
**Branch HEAD at handoff:** <commit sha>
**G1 attempts (per chunk):** [chunk-name: attempts]
**G2 attempts:** N
**spec-conformance verdict:** {verdict} ({log path})
**adversarial-reviewer verdict:** {verdict or "skipped (no auto-trigger surface match)"} ({log path or n/a})
**pr-reviewer verdict:** {verdict} ({log path})
**Fix-loop iterations:** N
**dual-reviewer verdict:** {verdict} | REVIEW_GAP: Codex CLI unavailable ({log path or n/a})
**Doc-sync gate:** [verdict per doc]
**Open issues for finalisation:** [list of non-blocking findings deferred to ChatGPT review]
```

## Step 11 — current-focus.md update

Update the mission-control block in `tasks/current-focus.md`:

```
status: REVIEWING
last_updated: {YYYY-MM-DD}
```

Keep `active_spec`, `active_plan`, `build_slug`, and `branch` unchanged. Only `status` and `last_updated` change.

Update the prose body below the mission-control block to match. Status enum transitions `BUILDING → REVIEWING`. Per the existing prose-canonical rule: if prose and block disagree, prose wins — keep them in sync.

## Step 12 — End-of-phase prompt

If the handoff contains `REVIEW_GAP: Codex CLI unavailable` in `dual-reviewer verdict:`, prepend this warning before the end-of-phase message:

> **Dual-reviewer was skipped — reduced review coverage for this build.** The Codex pass was unavailable. `chatgpt-pr-review` in Phase 3 will be the primary second-opinion pass; consider running `dual-reviewer` manually if Codex becomes available before merge.

Then print verbatim:

> **Phase 2 (BUILD) complete.**
>
> All chunks built. Branch-level review pass complete. Doc-sync gate complete.
> Handoff updated at `tasks/builds/{slug}/handoff.md`.
> `tasks/current-focus.md` → status `REVIEWING`.
>
> **Next:** open a new Claude Code session and type:
>
> ```
> launch finalisation
> ```
>
> This session ends here.

**Auto-commit at Phase 2 close:**

```bash
git add tasks/builds/{slug}/handoff.md tasks/builds/{slug}/progress.md tasks/current-focus.md tasks/review-logs/
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
chore(feature-coordinator): Phase 2 complete — branch-level review pass + doc-sync ({slug})

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
git push
```

Mark the final TodoWrite item complete and stop.

## Failure and escalation paths

### 1. architect plan-revision rounds exceed 3

Write `phase_status: PHASE_2_PAUSED_PLAN` to `tasks/builds/{slug}/handoff.md`. Escalate to the operator with the specific plan issues that could not be resolved. Do not proceed to plan-gate. Stop.

### 2. plan-gate "abort"

Write `phase_status: PHASE_2_ABORTED` to `tasks/builds/{slug}/handoff.md`. Set `tasks/current-focus.md` status to `NONE`. See abort write order below. Mark all remaining TodoWrite items completed. Exit.

### 3. Per-chunk plan-gap rounds exceed 2

Freeze all remaining chunks. Write `phase_status: PHASE_2_PAUSED_PLANGAP` and `paused_at_chunk: {chunk-name}` to `tasks/builds/{slug}/handoff.md`.

Recovery message (print verbatim):

> Re-launch feature-coordinator — it will re-invoke architect from §2.6 with the full spec + current branch diff to produce a revised plan for the remaining chunks. **Architect MUST produce a complete revised plan for ALL remaining chunks — incremental patching of the existing plan is forbidden.**

Stop.

### 4. G1/G2/G3 exceed 3 fix attempts

Escalate with full diagnostics: the exact error output, what was attempted in each round, and a root-cause hypothesis. Do not attempt a fourth fix round. Do not mark the gate as passed. Stop until operator direction is given.

### 5. spec-conformance NON_CONFORMANT after 2 rounds

Escalate to the operator with the outstanding conformance gaps. Do not proceed to pr-reviewer. Stop until the operator provides direction (manual fix or spec deviation decision).

### 6. pr-reviewer fix-loop exceeds 3 rounds

Escalate with the full list of unresolved Blocking findings and the reviewer's reasoning for each. Do not mark pr-reviewer as approved. Stop.

### 7. dual-reviewer Codex unavailable

Skip with note `REVIEW_GAP: Codex CLI unavailable` in `progress.md`. Do NOT block. Continue to Step 9. The REVIEW_GAP note propagates to the handoff and the end-of-phase prompt.

### 8. Doc-sync gate — missing verdict

Block. Cannot exit Phase 2. The missing verdict must be either filled in or confirmed `n/a` by the operator. Do not write handoff or update current-focus until all verdicts are present.

---

### Abort invariant

On any abort or hard-escalation path, `tasks/current-focus.md` MUST end in one of: `NONE` (full abort) OR a named status with a matching `phase_status: *_PAUSED | *_ABORTED` entry in `handoff.md`. Ambiguous state — non-NONE status with no matching handoff entry — is a pipeline bug and must never be left behind.

### Abort write order

Always write `handoff.md` first, then update `tasks/current-focus.md`. Never reverse this order.
